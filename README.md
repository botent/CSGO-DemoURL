## Tech

This projects uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Steam](https://github.com/ValvePython/steam) - ValvePython/Steam
- [CSGO](https://github.com/ValvePython/csgo) - ValvePython/CSGO
- [Gevent](https://github.com/gevent/gevent) - gevent is a coroutine -based Python networking library that uses greenlet to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the libev or libuv event loop.


And of course this project itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/botent/CSGO-DemoURL) on GitHub.
